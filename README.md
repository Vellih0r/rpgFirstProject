    About devs and project:

  This project for us is all about learning python, OOP, in/out, loops, conditions and stuff.

"We" - it's a group of 3 programmers:
Vellichor
Shadowww
Senku_qq

    What are in the game:
  In summer 2024 we decided to start learning python, and it's our first project.
It's a small console rpg game. User can decide what to do by writing messages. In the game you can fish, fight some enemies, buy items, do some special actions in battle, drink potions, heal in hospital after battle and challenge the boss!

    We used such libraries:
random - random numbers
colorama - for coloring text (needs to be intalled)
pyglet - for music (needs to be installed)
