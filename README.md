    About devs and project:

  This project for us is all about learning python, OOP, in/out, loops, conditions and stuff.
    In summer 2024 we decided to start learning python, and it's our first project.

Our team of 3 friends - programmers:

Vellichor

Shadowww

Senku-qq

    What are in the game:
It's a small console rpg game. User can decide what to do by writing messages. In the game you can fish, fight some enemies, buy items and potions, do some special actions in battle, use potions, heal in hospital after battle and challenge the boss!

    We used such libraries:
random - random numbers

colorama - for coloring text (needs to be intalled)

pyglet - for music (needs to be installed)
